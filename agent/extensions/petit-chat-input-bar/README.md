# petit-chat-input-bar

A tiny companion sprite that sits above the editor (a la Vibe's petit chat).
Purely cosmetic — no commands, no config. Each session randomly selects one
of the available companions, which then remains static for that session.

The selected pet is drawn in its neutral pose, anchored just above the input
bar's top border so its feet share the border row. One possible selection is:

## Why each selection is static

The selected sprite never animates. Pi periodically re-renders the TUI, and
each render resets the scrollback viewport to the bottom — so a per-frame
animation would yank the view down every tick. Keeping the pet on a single
neutral frame avoids that entirely while still giving the input bar a little
personality.

## Placement

The sprite is rendered as a non-capturing overlay anchored to the bottom-right
of the screen, then repositioned every frame to track the editor's top border
as it moves (multiline input, `/model` selector, thinking-level border
changes, …). It hides itself automatically when:

- the terminal is narrower than 32 cols or shorter than 10 rows, or
- the editor border can't be located (e.g. a full-screen overlay is open).

The feet row is composited on top of the editor's border line so the artwork
stays intact while visually resting on it. The border's live ANSI color (which
changes with thinking level / bash mode) is sampled and preserved through the
leading blank cells.
